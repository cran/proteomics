Title: Statistical Analysis of High Throughput Proteomics Data
Description: Provides methods for making inference in isobaric labelled
    LC-MS/MS experiments, i.e. iTRAQ experiments. It provides a function that
    reasonably parses a CSV-export from Proteome Discoverer(TM) into a data
    frame that can be easily handled in R. Functions and methods are provided
    for quality control, filtering, norming, and the calculation of response
    variables for further analysis. The merging of multiple iTRAQ experiments
    with respect to a reference is also covered.
